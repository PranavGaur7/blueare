**blueare** is a Redis clone I'm building from scratch using C++.  
This is a work-in-progress project aimed at understanding how Redis works internally.

## 🛠️ Current Progress

- Basic REPL (command-line interface)
- In-memory key-value storage
- Supported commands: `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`

## 📦 Getting Started

### Requirements
- C++17 or above
- `make`

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PranavGaur7/blueare.git
cd blueare
make
./blueare
```
**Note:** This project is still under development.
